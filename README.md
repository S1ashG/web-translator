An immersive, bilingual web page translation extension that provides a side-by-side reading experience. This tool is designed to help users learn languages and read foreign content with ease by displaying translations directly beneath the original text.

This project is heavily inspired by the popular "Immersive Translate" extension and focuses on providing a robust, configurable, and cost-effective translation experience for web pages.

### A Note on Development: An AI Collaboration

A special aspect of this project is that it was developed in close collaboration with a large language model (Google's Gemini). A significant portion of the code, from the initial scaffolding and feature implementation to complex debugging and refactoring, was generated and guided through conversational AI. This repository serves as a practical example of human-AI partnership in software development.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Immersive Translation:** Displays translations paragraph-by-paragraph, directly below the original text, for a seamless bilingual reading experience.
-   **Multiple Backends:** Supports three powerful translation service providers:
    -   **DeepL**
    -   **Google Gemini**
    -   **Deepseek**
-   **Translate-on-Scroll:** To save on API costs, the extension only translates content that is currently visible on your screen. As you scroll down, new text is automatically translated on demand.
-   **Highly Configurable:** A detailed options page allows you to:
    -   Switch between translation services.
    -   Securely store a separate API key for each service.
    -   Fetch and select specific models for LLM providers (Gemini, Deepseek).
    -   Customize the System and User Prompts for LLM-based translations.
    -   Adjust performance settings like batch size and request delay to respect API rate limits.
-   **Keyboard Shortcut:** Start or stop the translation on any page with a simple keyboard shortcut (`Alt+T`). The toggle is tab-specific, allowing you to manage translations independently on different pages.

    -   Enter your personal API key for the selected service. The extension will automatically save and switch keys as you change services.
    -   If you selected Gemini or Deepseek, click the "Fetch/Refresh Models" button to validate your key and load available models into the dropdown. Select a model.
    -   (Optional) Adjust the LLM prompts or performance settings to your liking.
